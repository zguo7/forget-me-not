Dear hiring manager,

I am applying for the position of Senior Software Engineer, Services and Applications that you posted on Greenhouse. I believe I possess the necessary skills you are seeking for with this position and would make a valuable addition to the team.

I have over 7+ years building services/APIs using Java, Spring, MySQL/Oracle, Hibernate, and AWS. I enjoy agile development and use Jenkins/Kubernetes for CICD with test automation. I have experience working both start-ups and public company. 

My daily routine includes working with PM/other teams to design new features/services, enhancing existing components, fixing issues, production support (on-call monitoring and release driving), and code review. 

I have attached my resume and I look forward to speaking with you further about the position. 

Sincerely,
Zhenshan
