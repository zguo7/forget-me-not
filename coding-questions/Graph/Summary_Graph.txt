1. longest consecutive sequence: the straightforward way is to sort the array first, and then loop one more time and use 2 pointers to keep track of the start and end index and another variable for the maximum consecutive length. the complexity is the sorting part O(nlogn). A better/desired way is to use set and mimic deep search in graph for the longest sequence. first, put all elements to a hashset, then take one element from the set and search on both direction for the longest. each time an element is checked, remove it from set till the set is empty. this way, the complexity is O(n)
