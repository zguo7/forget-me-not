Problem Statement #
Given a sorted number array and two integers ‘K’ and ‘X’, find ‘K’ closest numbers to ‘X’
in the array. Return the numbers in the sorted order. ‘X’ is not necessarily present in
the array.

Example 1:

Input: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], K = 3, X = 7 Output: [6, 7, 8] Example 2:

Input: [2, 4, 5, 6, 9], K = 3, X = 6 Output: [4, 5, 6] Example 3:

Input: [2, 4, 5, 6, 9], K = 3, X = 10 Output: [5, 6, 9]


Solution #
This problem follows the Top ‘K’ Numbers pattern. The biggest difference in this problem
is that we need to find the closest (to ‘X’) numbers compared to finding the overall
largest numbers. Another difference is that the given array is sorted.

Utilizing a similar approach, we can find the numbers closest to ‘X’ through the following
algorithm:

Since the array is sorted, we can first find the number closest to ‘X’ through Binary
Search. Let’s say that number is ‘Y’. The ‘K’ closest numbers to ‘Y’ will be adjacent to
‘Y’ in the array. We can search in both directions of ‘Y’ to find the closest numbers. We
can use a heap to efficiently search for the closest numbers. We will take ‘K’ numbers in
both directions of ‘Y’ and push them in a Min Heap sorted by their absolute difference
from ‘X’. This will ensure that the numbers with the smallest difference from ‘X’ (i.e.,
closest to ‘X’) can be extracted easily from the Min Heap. Finally, we will extract the
top ‘K’ numbers from the Min Heap to find the required numbers.

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(logN + K*logK). We need
O(logN) for Binary Search and O(K*logK) to insert the numbers in the Min
Heap, as well as to sort the output array.

Space complexity #
The space complexity will be O(K), as we need to put a maximum of 2K numbers in the heap.

Alternate Solution using Two Pointers #
After finding the number closest to ‘X’ through Binary Search, we can use the Two Pointers
approach to find the ‘K’ closest numbers. Let’s say the closest number is ‘Y’. We can have
a left pointer to move back from ‘Y’ and a right pointer to move forward from ‘Y’. At any
stage, whichever number pointed out by the left or the right pointer gives the smaller
difference from ‘X’ will be added to our result list.

To keep the resultant list sorted we can use a Queue. So whenever we take the number
pointed out by the left pointer, we will append it at the beginning of the list and
whenever we take the number pointed out by the right pointer we will append it at the end
of the list.

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(logN + K). We need O(logN) for Binary
Search and O(K) for finding the ‘K’ closest numbers using the two pointers.

Space complexity #
If we ignoring the space required for the output list, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
