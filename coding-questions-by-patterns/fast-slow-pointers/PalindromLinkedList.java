Palindrome LinkedList (medium) #
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to check if the LinkedList is a
palindrome or not.

Your algorithm should use constant space and the input LinkedList should be in the
original form once the algorithm is finished. The algorithm should have O(N) time
complexity where ‘N’ is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.

Example 1:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> null
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 2 -> null
Output: false


Solution #
As we know, a palindrome LinkedList will have nodes values that read the same backward or
forward. This means that if we divide the LinkedList into two halves, the node values of
the first half in the forward direction should be similar to the node values of the second
half in the backward direction. As we have been given a Singly LinkedList, we can’t move
in the backward direction. To handle this, we will perform the following steps:

We can use the Fast & Slow pointers method similar to Middle of the LinkedList to find the
middle node of the LinkedList. Once we have the middle of the LinkedList, we will reverse
the second half.

Then, we will compare the first half with the reversed second half to see if the
LinkedList represents a palindrome. 

Finally, we will reverse the second half of the LinkedList again to revert and bring the
LinkedList back to its original form.

Code #

class ListNode {
  int value = 0;
  ListNode next;

  ListNode(int value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
}

class PalindromicLinkedList {

  public static boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null)
      return true;

    // find middle of the LinkedList
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
      slow = slow.next;
      fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    ListNode headSecondHalf = reverse(slow); // reverse the second half
    ListNode copyHeadSecondHalf = headSecondHalf; // store the head of reversed part to revert back later

    // compare the first and the second half
    while (head != null && headSecondHalf != null) {
      if (head.value != headSecondHalf.value) {
        break; // not a palindrome
      }
      head = head.next;
      headSecondHalf = headSecondHalf.next;
    }

    reverse(copyHeadSecondHalf); // revert the reverse of the second half
    if (head == null || headSecondHalf == null) // if both halves match
      return true;
    return false;
  }

  private static ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
    ListNode prev = null;
    while (head != null) {
      ListNode next = head.next;
      head.next = prev;
      prev = head;
      head = next;
    }
    return prev;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ListNode head = new ListNode(2);
    head.next = new ListNode(4);
    head.next.next = new ListNode(6);
    head.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);
    head.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(2);
    System.out.println("Is palindrome: " + PalindromicLinkedList.isPalindrome(head));

    head.next.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(2);
    System.out.println("Is palindrome: " + PalindromicLinkedList.isPalindrome(head));
  }
}


Time complexity #
The above algorithm will have a time complexity of O(N) where ‘N’ is the number of nodes
in the LinkedList.

Space complexity #
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
