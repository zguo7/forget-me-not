Problem Statement #
Given the head of a LinkedList and two positions ‘p’ and ‘q’, reverse the LinkedList from position ‘p’ to ‘q’.

Solution #
The problem follows the In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern. We can use a similar
approach as discussed in Reverse a LinkedList. Here are the steps we need to follow:

Skip the first p-1 nodes, to reach the node at position p. Remember the node at position
p-1 to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list. Next, reverse the nodes from p
to q using the same approach discussed in Reverse a LinkedList. Connect the p-1 and q+1
nodes to the reversed sub-list.


import java.util.*;

class ListNode {
  int value = 0;
  ListNode next;

  ListNode(int value) {
    this.value = value;
  }
}

class ReverseSubList {

  public static ListNode reverse(ListNode head, int p, int q) {
    if (p == q)
      return head;

    // after skipping 'p-1' nodes, current will point to 'p'th node
    ListNode current = head, previous = null;
    for (int i = 0; current != null && i < p - 1; ++i) {
      previous = current;
      current = current.next;
    }

    // we are interested in three parts of the LinkedList, part before index 'p', part between 'p' and 
    // 'q', and the part after index 'q'
    ListNode lastNodeOfFirstPart = previous; // points to the node at index 'p-1'
    // after reversing the LinkedList 'current' will become the last node of the sub-list
    ListNode lastNodeOfSubList = current;
    ListNode next = null; // will be used to temporarily store the next node
    // reverse nodes between 'p' and 'q'
    for (int i = 0; current != null && i < q - p + 1; i++) {
      next = current.next;
      current.next = previous;
      previous = current;
      current = next;
    }

    // connect with the first part
    if (lastNodeOfFirstPart != null)
      lastNodeOfFirstPart.next = previous; // 'previous' is now the first node of the sub-list
    else // this means p == 1 i.e., we are changing the first node (head) of the LinkedList
      head = previous;

    // connect with the last part
    lastNodeOfSubList.next = current;

    return head;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
    head.next = new ListNode(2);
    head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
    head.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);
    head.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(5);

    ListNode result = ReverseSubList.reverse(head, 2, 4);
    System.out.print("Nodes of the reversed LinkedList are: ");
    while (result != null) {
      System.out.print(result.value + " ");
      result = result.next;
    }
  }
}


Time complexity #
The time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N)) where ‘N’ is the total number of
nodes in the LinkedList.

Space complexity #
We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1).


Similar Questions #
Problem 1: Reverse the first ‘k’ elements of a given LinkedList.

Solution: This problem can be easily converted to our parent problem; to reverse the first
‘k’ nodes of the list, we need to pass p=1 and q=k.

Problem 2: Given a LinkedList with ‘n’ nodes, reverse it based on its size in the
following way:

If ‘n’ is even, reverse the list in a group of n/2 nodes. If n is odd, keep the middle
node as it is, reverse the first ‘n/2’ nodes and reverse the last ‘n/2’ nodes. Solution:
When ‘n’ is even we can perform the following steps:

Reverse first ‘n/2’ nodes: head = reverse(head, 1, n/2) 
Reverse last ‘n/2’ nodes: head =
reverse(head, n/2 + 1, n) When ‘n’ is odd, our algorithm will look like:

head = reverse(head, 1, n/2) head = reverse(head, n/2 + 2, n) 
Please note the function
call in the second step. We’re skipping two elements as we will be skipping the middle
element.
