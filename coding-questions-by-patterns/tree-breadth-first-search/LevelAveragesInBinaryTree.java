Problem Statement #
Given a binary tree, populate an array to represent the averages of all of its levels.

Solution #
This problem follows the Binary Tree Level Order Traversal pattern. We can follow the same
BFS approach. The only difference will be that instead of keeping track of all nodes of a
level, we will only track the running sum of the values of all nodes in each level. In the
end, we will append the average of the current level to the result array.

import java.util.*;

class TreeNode {
  int val;
  TreeNode left;
  TreeNode right;

  TreeNode(int x) {
    val = x;
  }
};

class LevelAverage {
  public static List<Double> findLevelAverages(TreeNode root) {
    List<Double> result = new ArrayList<>();
    if (root == null)
      return result;

    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
      int levelSize = queue.size();
      double levelSum = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
        TreeNode currentNode = queue.poll();
        // add the node's value to the running sum
        levelSum += currentNode.val;
        // insert the children of current node to the queue
        if (currentNode.left != null)
          queue.offer(currentNode.left);
        if (currentNode.right != null)
          queue.offer(currentNode.right);
      }
      // append the current level's average to the result array
      result.add(levelSum / levelSize);
    }

    return result;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(12);
    root.left = new TreeNode(7);
    root.right = new TreeNode(1);
    root.left.left = new TreeNode(9);
    root.left.right = new TreeNode(2);
    root.right.left = new TreeNode(10);
    root.right.right = new TreeNode(5);
    List<Double> result = LevelAverage.findLevelAverages(root);
    System.out.print("Level averages are: " + result);
  }
}

Time complexity #
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of
nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

Space complexity #
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for the
queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at
the lowest level), therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.

Similar Problems #
Problem 1: Find the largest value on each level of a binary tree.

Solution: We will follow a similar approach, but instead of having a running sum we will
track the maximum value of each level.
