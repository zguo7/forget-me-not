Introduction
This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot
of problems involving intervals, we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge
intervals if they overlap.

Given two intervals (‘a’ and ‘b’), there will be six different ways the two intervals can
relate to each other:

1. a and b don't overlap, and b ends after a
2. a and b overlap, and b ends after a
3. a completely overlaps b
4. a and b overlap, and a ends after b
5. b completely overlaps a
6. a and b don't overlap, and a ends after b


Understanding the above six cases will help us in solving all intervals related
problems. Let’s jump onto our first problem to understand the Merge Interval pattern.
