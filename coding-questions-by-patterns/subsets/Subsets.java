Given a set with distinct elements, find all of its distinct subsets.

Example 1:

Input: [1, 3]
Output: [], [1], [3], [1,3]
Example 2:

Input: [1, 5, 3]
Output: [], [1], [5], [3], [1,5], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3]


Solution #
To generate all subsets of the given set, we can use the Breadth First Search (BFS)
approach. We can start with an empty set, iterate through all numbers one-by-one, and add
them to existing sets to create new subsets.

Let’s take the example-2 mentioned above to go through each step of our algorithm:

Given set: [1, 5, 3]

Start with an empty set: [[]] Add the first number (1) to all the existing subsets to
create new subsets: [[], [1]]; Add the second number (5) to all the existing subsets: [[],
[1], [5], [1,5]]; Add the third number (3) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [5],
[1,5], [3], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3]].


import java.util.*;

class Subsets {

  public static List<List<Integer>> findSubsets(int[] nums) {
    List<List<Integer>> subsets = new ArrayList<>();
    // start by adding the empty subset
    subsets.add(new ArrayList<>());
    for (int currentNumber : nums) {
      // we will take all existing subsets and insert the current number in them to create new subsets
      int n = subsets.size();
      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // create a new subset from the existing subset and insert the current element to it
        List<Integer> set = new ArrayList<>(subsets.get(i));
        set.add(currentNumber);
        subsets.add(set);
      }
    }
    return subsets;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<List<Integer>> result = Subsets.findSubsets(new int[] { 1, 3 });
    System.out.println("Here is the list of subsets: " + result);

    result = Subsets.findSubsets(new int[] { 1, 5, 3 });
    System.out.println("Here is the list of subsets: " + result);
  }
}


Time complexity #
Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles as we add each element to all the
existing subsets, the time complexity of the above algorithm is O(2^N), where ‘N’ is the
total number of elements in the input set. This also means that, in the end, we will have
a total of O(2^N) subsets.

Space complexity #
All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we will have
a total of O(2^N) subsets, the space complexity of our algorithm is also O(2^N).
